Bright Mart Retail – Data Analytics Project

 Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow, including data cleaning, transformation, modeling, visualization, and insights generation using:
•	Power BI
•	Power Query
•	DAX Measures
The analysis focuses on Bright Mart Retail, using four foundational datasets: Customers, Sales, Calendar, and Products.

 Tools & Technologies
•	Power BI – for data modeling and interactive dashboards
•	Power Query – for data cleaning and transformation
•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for creating measures and KPIs
•	Excel/CSV – raw data sources

 Data Preparation
Bright Mart Retail’s analysis was based on four initially messy datasets: Customers, Sales, Calendar, and Products.
Data Cleaning Using Power Query
•	Removed blank rows and unnecessary columns
•	Corrected data types (dates, text, numbers)
•	Fixed formatting issues ( symbols in Product IDs, inconsistent unit prices)
•	Standardised headers and table structure
•	Replaced invalid or text-based date values
•	Ensured data consistency across all datasets

Data Modeling & DAX
After cleaning the data, a star schema model was built in Power BI.
Custom DAX measures were created to compute key performance indicators such as:
•	Total Sales
•	Total Cost
•	Total Profit
•	Profit Margin %
•	YTD Sales
•	Category Performance
•	Regional Sales
These measures form the foundation of the dashboard insights.

Visualizations & Dashboard Design
I created and designed visuals that not only display numbers but tell a clear story.
The dashboard includes:
•	Overall, Sales, Cost & Profit Overview
•	Profit Margin Analysis
•	Top vs. Bottom Performing Categories
•	Regional Sales Breakdown
•	Age Group Contribution
•	Monthly and Year-to-Date Trends
Each visualization was built to highlight business performance, customer behaviour, and growth opportunities.
